# Hello, I'm José Arturo Ornelas Brand 👋

### Independent Researcher | Architect of Neurosymbolic Systems

> *"From Black Box Probability to Glass Box Determinism."*

I am an independent researcher dedicated to developing the **Unified Holographic Resonance Theory (UHRT)**. My work fuses arithmetic proportionality, geometric dimensionality, and entropic dynamics to build Neurosymbolic AI systems that are deterministic, interpretable, and radically efficient.

## 🔭 Research Ecosystem & Projects

Below are the five fundamental pillars of my research, unified under the UHRT framework.

### 1\. Unified Holographic Resonance Theory (UHRT)

> **The unification of physics and semantics under arithmetic resonance.**

**Summary:**
The Unified Holographic Resonance Theory (UHRT) is a conceptual and computable framework that fuses arithmetic proportionality (MEDC) and entropic dynamics (LCF) to model reality as a holographic system. It postulates that the laws of the Rule of Three (Simple and Compound) define dimensional stability (2D and 3D), and that the "Glitch" is the quantum catalyst that forces dimensional evolution

UHRT introduces the Universal Binary Scale (UBS) as a unifying metric and a Super Metric ($\mathcal{UBS}_{UHM}$) that quantifies dimensional dilution in bits. Simulations demonstrate that arithmetic failures trigger entropic pruning (reduction of informational complexity) to restore system stability.

### 2\. A Rigorous Triadic Framework for Neurosymbolic Reasoning

> **Integer logic for sparse circuits.**

**Summary:**
This framework proposes an integer-based symbolic logic for neurosymbolic reasoning, acting as a candidate model for the underlying logic of "sparse circuits" in AI. It moves reasoning beyond floating-point vector addition toward a ratio-based balance. All logic uses exact rational arithmetic (`fractions` library) and normalization via the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

The framework is built on two complementary, discrete functions:
**Generative Function ($\Phi_G$):** Predicts a new concept $C_4$ from three inputs $C_1, C_2, C_3$ and a known balancing rule $(a, b)$.
**Discovery Function ($\Phi_D$):** Infers the minimal, co-prime balancing rule $(a, b)$ from a set of four known concepts.

The framework validates its descriptive power by modeling deterministic laws like Classical Mechanics (e.g., $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$), correctly discovering the balancing coefficients $a=1, b=2$.

### 3\. Bipolar Universal Semantic Scale (BUSS) - V2.0

> **Quantification of semantic opposition.**

**Summary:**
The BUSS framework focuses on quantifying semantic opposition (Thesis/Antithesis) as a measurable pole on an orthogonal axis. This approach uses Centered Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to map concepts. Empirical validation showed that BUSS achieves a statistically superior angular separation of opposing concepts (e.g., 1-star vs. 5-star reviews) in a 50,000-document corpus, outperforming LSA.

**Key Operational Results:**

  * A Logistic Regression classifier trained on BUSS projections (V4, 500-dim) achieved **87.16%** accuracy in sentiment classification.
  * Provided empirical proof that the failure in generative fine-tuning with DialoGPT-small was due to loss imbalance, where the Language Model Loss ($\approx 4.68$) dominated and essentially ignored the Bipolar Loss ($\approx 0.12$).

### 4\. Bipolar Triadic Neurosymbolic Framework (Fusion & Test)

> **Foundational snapshot for the next generation.**

**Summary:**
This is a proposed hybrid framework and future research program for the next generation of AI. It represents the fusion of the arithmetic stability of the Triadic Framework and the semantic opposition of the BUSS Scale, unified under the UHRT logic.

The goal is to create a stable neurosymbolic reasoning model that requires two fundamental components: arithmetic balance (using GCD) and semantic opposition (using vectors $V_{pos} - V_{neg}$). This framework seeks to formalize the hypothesis that reason and stable meaning must exhibit both symbolic rigor and inherent duality.

**Key Results (UHRT v2.0):**

  * 🚀 Achieved a peak of **2.82 million exact analogies/sec** on CPU.
  * 📐 Verified the emergence of continuous calculus from discrete sums with an error of $\epsilon=0.016$ at $N=1000$ steps.
  * 🔗 Quantified unification with the metric $\mathcal{UBS}_{UHM}=\mathbf{0.0636}$ (minimum entropy).

### 5\. Shadow Engine: Cubical Triads and Abductive Discovery

> **The geometric and topological necessity of integer proportions using HoTT.**

**Summary:**
[cite\_start]This project demonstrates that the integer triadic framework is the **classical shadow of a rigorous synthetic geometry of proportions** in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)[cite: 55]. [cite\_start]It formalizes GCD normalization as a projection to a terminal object in a Higher Inductive Type (HIT)[cite: 56]. [cite\_start]Structural degeneracies in data manifest as **topological obstructions**, which are computable witnesses that enable the rigorous **abductive discovery** of hidden integer factors[cite: 4, 57]. [cite\_start]The simplicity metric $K=1/(ab)$ arises naturally as the Boltzmann weight $e^{-E}$ under a logarithmic geodesic metric[cite: 5, 58].
